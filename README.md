# Server-basedChat
This is a project for my Computer Network class, running on UNIX server using Python
- The project is a resemble of a chat room that allows many different clients to connect to a server to send and receive messages. Clients are able to talk to one another by sending encrypted messages to the server and the server will relays the messages to the communicating client. 

- A client can only participate in one conversation at a time. Any other clients will be notified whenever they try to connect to a already-in-a-conversation client.

- If a client is offline, others cannot connect to it.
